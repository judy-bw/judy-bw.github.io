## This is a post to show you why I decided to take Electronic Textiles!

My name is Judy and I'm a freshman at Williams College. I'm a potential **Art History** or **English** major! I do not have much sewing experience, but over the summer I made an embroidery sampler and turned it into a pillow! Here's a photo:

I do not have any programming experience, except for one Python class in 9th grade. 

In this class, I hope to learn how to make textiles light up!

One boring fact about me is that I have two brothers.
