## This is a post to show you my Sweater Weather assignment!

For this assignment, we were practicing if...else statements. So, we had to make a "thermometer" that would print out a message for any given temperature input. 

Here's a photo of the output if you input 60 degrees.

I do not have any programming experience, except for one Python class in 9th grade. 

In this class, I hope to learn how to make textiles light up!

One boring fact about me is that I have two brothers.
